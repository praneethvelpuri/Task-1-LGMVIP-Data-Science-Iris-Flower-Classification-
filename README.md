# Task-1-LGMVIP-Data-Science-Iris-Flower-Classification-

Iris Flower Classification Project

This project classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The features used for classification are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project uses a logistic regression model to classify the iris flowers. The model is trained on the first 4 features of the iris dataset, which are the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model is then tested on the remaining 50 flowers in the dataset. The model correctly classifies 97.37% of the flowers.

The model can be used to classify new iris flowers. To do this, simply pass the features of the new flower to the model. The model will then predict the species of the flower.

In this the model is used to predict the species of a flower with sepal length 5.1 cm, sepal width 3.5 cm, petal length 1.4 cm, and petal width 0.2 cm. The model predicts that this flower is a setosa flower.

The accuracy of the model can be improved by using a larger dataset. However, the accuracy of the model will not improve significantly if the dataset is too large.
